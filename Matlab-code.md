# Optimized-synthetic-turbulence-matlab
This code allows you to generate optimized synthetic turbulence in the Matlab software environment. 
The main parameters are set at the beginning of the program: the size of the computational area, the grid step for each coordinate, the number of wave vectors for a given energy spectrum and the distribution by wave numbers. 
The result of the program is the construction of a turbulent velocity field (of each component) in physical space, the distribution of kinetic energy in physical space at the initial moment of time. To obtain data at an arbitrary point in time, you can use a time loop with a time step specified in the program. In addition, the density distribution of particles suspended in a liquid was obtained.
